"""Push a delta patch to the board over SMP, the way a phone would.

WHY THIS EXISTS BESIDE ultrawidelock_push.py. ultrawidelock_push speaks the native framed protocol
over an L2CAP CoC, which no phone app can open. This one speaks mcumgr over
GATT -- byte for byte what nRF Device Manager sends -- so the device half can be
proved from a Mac before anyone starts tapping at a phone. When this works and
the app does not, the fault is in the app or the file it is given, not in the
firmware.

    scripts/ultrawidelock_smp.py build/cdk.wdfu          push a patch
    scripts/ultrawidelock_smp.py --list                 read the image list and stop

Requires the board to be built with SMP=1 (apps/dwm3001cdk-lock/overlay-smp.conf).

CBOR IS HAND-ROLLED HERE, deliberately. The maps mcumgr exchanges are half a
dozen keys of ints and byte strings, and vendoring a CBOR library into the OTA
venv to encode that would be more moving parts than the encoder itself.

#
# Two corrections to what this file used to say.
#
# The SMP service IS advertised on an SMP=1 build -- the comment here claimed it
# never was, and the scan therefore ignored the one UUID that identifies exactly
# the service this tool needs. It is now the primary match.
#
# And the local name is SHORTENED. An advertisement is 31 bytes; 24 of them are
# the credential service data, so the name does not fit and the controller emits
# a shortened-local-name AD instead. `"ultrawidelock" in "ultrawidelo"` is
# false, which is why a board sitting at -53 dBm was reported as "not
# advertising -- is it powered?". The name test is now a prefix match in the
# direction that survives truncation, and it is a fallback rather than the
# primary.
#
# Service DATA is checked as well as the UUID list, for the reason
# ultrawidelock_push.py documents at length: a commissionable Matter

# characteristic is a datagram: one write is one packet, and the controller
# fragments. A serial port is a byte stream with no packet boundaries at all, so
# mcumgr defines its own framing on top, and this is that framing.
#
# Transcribed from zephyr/subsys/mgmt/mcumgr/transport/src/serial_util.c and
# zephyr/include/zephyr/mgmt/mcumgr/transport/serial.h:
#
#   packet   be16(len(body) + 2) || body || be16(crc16(body))
#   frame    be16(marker) || base64(slice of packet) || b"\n"
#   marker   0x0609 on a packet's first frame, 0x0414 on every continuation
#   limit    127 bytes per frame INCLUDING the markers and the newline
#
# The length word counts the CRC but not itself. A receiver checks a packet by
# running the same CRC over the body AND its trailing CRC and requiring zero.
#
# binascii.crc_hqx(data, 0) IS CRC-16/XMODEM -- poly 0x1021, init 0x0000, not
# reflected -- which is exactly what serial_util.c:30 calls crc16_itu_t(0, ...).

# is the reference the browser's copy is diffed against, so the fewer things in

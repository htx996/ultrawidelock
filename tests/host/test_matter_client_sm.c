/**
 * @file test_matter_client_sm.c — the schedule, without a clock.
 *
 * Everything here is a decision about time: how long a granted unlock is still
 * worth sending, how long to wait on each half of a handshake, how long to stay
 * out of the way after a failure. On hardware those are all invisible -- a lock
 * that retries too eagerly and one that gives up too early look identical from
 * the outside, which is a slow bug to find with a board and an easy one to pin
 * here.
 *
 * The state machine takes every timestamp as an argument, so this drives it
 * from a variable rather than a clock and can step over a backoff, a staleness
 * horizon, or the 49.7-day wrap in one line.

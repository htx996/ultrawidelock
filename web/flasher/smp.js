 * smp.js -- mcumgr over Web Bluetooth, for the DWM3001CDK.
 *
 * A port of scripts/ultrawidelock_smp.py. Same service, same characteristic,
 * same 8-byte header, same hand-rolled CBOR -- byte for byte what nRF Device
 * Manager sends, which is the whole reason the firmware half is already
 * proven. If this file and that script ever disagree, that script is right:
 * it is the one with a board attached to it.
 *
 * TWO THINGS WEB BLUETOOTH TAKES AWAY that the Python has:
 *
 *   The MTU. bleak reports the negotiated ATT MTU and the script sizes its
 *   chunks from it. Web Bluetooth exposes no MTU at all, on purpose, so the
 *   chunk here is fixed at the value the script computes from the 185-byte
 *   MTU it defaults to -- see BLE_CHUNK below.
 *
 *   Scanning. There is no discovery loop to filter; the browser runs the
 *   chooser. What requestDevice() filters on, and why the SMP service leads,
 *   is measured rather than assumed -- see the comment on connect().
 *
 * THE TRANSPORT IS A SEAM, not a given. Everything above it -- header, CBOR,
 * image group, upload loop, window handling -- is identical whether the bytes
 * leave over a radio or a cable, so `Smp` takes a transport object and serial.js
 * supplies the other one. That is what lets one page offer both.

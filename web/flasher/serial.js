 * serial.js -- SMP over WebSerial, which is mcumgr's serial framing.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. smp.js speaks the same 8-byte SMP header over Web
 * Bluetooth, and the two share every layer above this one: same header, same
 * CBOR, same image group, same upload loop. What differs is only how a packet
 * gets from here to the board. A GATT characteristic is a datagram -- one write
 * is one packet and the controller handles fragmentation. A serial port is a
 * byte stream with no packet boundaries at all, so mcumgr defines its own
 * framing on top, and this file is that framing and nothing else.
 *
 * WHAT IT UNLOCKS, and why it is worth a file. uart0 on the DWM3001CDK is the
 * J-Link OB's VCOM, it enumerates as USB CDC-ACM, and navigator.serial can open
 * it. TWO different things listen on that one port, at different times:
 *
 *   the application  CONFIG_MCUMGR_TRANSPORT_UART, bound to the already-chosen
 *                    zephyr,uart-mcumgr = &uart0. Serves the same group 1 that
 *                    the radio serves (ports/zephyr/dfu/dfu_smp_img.c), so a
 *                    delta over the cable and a delta over the air are the same
 *                    bytes through the same signature check and window gate.
 *   MCUboot          CONFIG_MCUBOOT_SERIAL + CONFIG_BOOT_SERIAL_UART, single
 *                    slot, direct upload (apps/dwm3001cdk-lock/sysbuild/mcuboot.conf).
 *                    A FULL image, with no probe, on a board whose application
 *                    does not run -- the two limits the radio path cannot
 *                    escape, because a delta needs a known starting image and a
 *                    radio needs firmware alive to serve it.
 *
 * Same framing for both, which is the point: this file does not know or care
 * which one answered.
 *
 * THE FRAMING, transcribed from the implementation rather than from memory:
 * zephyr/subsys/mgmt/mcumgr/transport/src/serial_util.c and
 * zephyr/include/zephyr/mgmt/mcumgr/transport/serial.h.
 *
 *   packet    be16(len(body) + 2) || body || be16(crc16(body))
 *   crc16     CRC-16/XMODEM -- poly 0x1021, init 0x0000, not reflected.
 *             serial_util.c:30 calls crc16_itu_t(0x0000, ...), which is that.
 *   frame     be16(marker) || base64(slice of packet) || '\n'
 *   marker    0x0609 on the first frame of a packet, 0x0414 on every
 *             continuation frame (serial.h:24,26)
 *   limit     127 bytes per frame INCLUDING the two marker bytes and the
 *             newline (serial.h:28)
 *
 * The length word counts the CRC but not itself. The receiver checks a packet
 * by running the same CRC over the body AND its trailing CRC and requiring zero
 * (serial_util.c:131-135), which is the usual trick and worth knowing when
 * reading the decoder below.
 *
 * WHERE THIS ENCODER DELIBERATELY DIFFERS FROM THE C, because anyone comparing
 * them side by side will notice and should not have to wonder.
 * mcumgr_serial_tx_pkt() emits base64 one three-byte triplet at a time, and
 * carries a `reminder`/`last` dance whose only job is to make sure the two CRC
 * bytes land in a frame with room for them -- it is streaming and cannot buffer
 * the tail. This file builds the whole packet first, CRC included, and then
 * slices it. Both are valid input to the same receiver, which reassembles by
 * the declared length and never learns how the sender chose to split. Slicing
 * is simpler and has no edge case around a CRC that does not fit.
 *
 * The slice sizes are still the C's, and they are not arbitrary:
 *   first frame   93 bytes -> base64 124 + 2 marker + 1 newline = 127 exactly
 *   later frames  90 bytes -> base64 120 + 2 marker + 1 newline = 123
 * 93 is ((127 - 3) >> 2) * 3 (serial_util.c:186). The 90 is the C's own
 * `max_input -= 3` after the first frame, which it never adds back; matching it
 * costs three bytes a frame and keeps the two encoders comparable.

/**
 * @file matter_im_client.h — sending a command, rather than answering one.
 *
 * matter_im.h is this node as an Interaction Model SERVER: it decodes what a
 * commissioner asked for and encodes the answer. This is the other direction,
 * and it is what the binding feature needs -- the lock telling another lock to
 * unlock:
 *
 *   out  TimedRequest          (protocol 0x0001, opcode 0x0A)
 *   in   StatusResponse        (protocol 0x0001, opcode 0x01)
 *   out  InvokeRequest         (protocol 0x0001, opcode 0x08)
 *   in   InvokeResponse        (protocol 0x0001, opcode 0x09)
 *
 * The TimedRequest is not optional for UnlockDoor. DoorLock's lock and unlock
 * commands are Timed Invoke commands, so a peer that receives a bare
 * InvokeRequest for one answers NEEDS_TIMED_INTERACTION and does nothing -- a
 * refusal that looks exactly like a permissions problem and is not one. This
 * node's own server already enforces the same rule on its commissioner
 * (matter_im_timed_request_decode), so the failure is worth recognising from
 * both ends.
 *
 * ONE COMMAND PER MESSAGE, never a batch, matching what this node's server
 * accepts and what its Sigma2 advertises in MaxPathsPerInvoke.

/**
 * @file matter_client_sm.h — when to talk to the bound lock, and when to stop.
 *
 * matter_case_client.h is the handshake; this is what decides to run one. It
 * sits between an unlock that has already been granted locally and a peer that
 * may be resolvable, reachable, both or neither:
 *
 *   want -> resolve -> Sigma1 -> Sigma3 -> ready -> invoke
 *                  \______ failed ______/
 *                             |
 *                          backoff
 *
 * THE RULE THIS EXISTS TO ENFORCE: none of it may delay the local unlock. The
 * bolt on this board is a Wallet notification and an LED, and both have already
 * happened by the time anything here runs. So every entry point returns
 * immediately, nothing blocks, and a peer that is unreachable costs the person
 * at the door nothing at all.
 *
 * Like matter_pase_sm.h, no time or randomness is taken from the environment:
 * every function that could care takes @p now_ms, so the whole schedule --
 * backoff, staleness, the retry horizon -- is testable without a clock.
 *
 * Time is compared as a SIGNED difference throughout. A uint32_t millisecond
 * clock wraps every 49.7 days, and `now >= deadline` is wrong for the tick
 * either side of that; `(int32_t)(now - deadline) >= 0` is right across it.

/**
 * How long a granted unlock is still worth sending.

 * NOT a network timeout -- it is a statement about doors. Somebody walked up,
 * the local lock opened, and the bound lock is being told to open too. If that
 * message has not gone out within a few seconds the person is through the door
 * or has given up and left, and a lock that opens by itself half a minute later
 * is a surprise rather than a feature. So a pending want EXPIRES; it is not
 * retried until it succeeds.
 *
 * Retrying the SESSION is a different question and has no such limit: a warm
 * session costs nothing to keep and is the whole reason a second walk-up is

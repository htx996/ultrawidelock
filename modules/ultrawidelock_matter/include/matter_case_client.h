/**
 * @file matter_case_client.h — the same proof, from the other end.
 *
 * matter_case.h is this node answering a CASE handshake somebody else started.
 * This file is the node STARTING one: it is what a Matter client needs before
 * it can send a command to another node on the fabric, which is what the
 * binding feature does when the UWB gate fires.
 *
 *   Sigma1  this node -> peer   who I want, and my ephemeral key
 *   Sigma2  peer -> this node   its certificate chain, signed, encrypted
 *   Sigma3  this node -> peer   the same, in the other direction
 *
 * Every primitive is already in matter_case.c -- the ECDH, the signing, the
 * destination identifier, the AEAD, the key schedule. What is new here is the
 * DIRECTION: the tag numbers Sigma2 and Sigma3 put the two ephemeral keys
 * under swap roles between the halves, and getting that backwards produces
 * messages that encode, decode, and never verify. Each function below says
 * which role it is writing.
 *
 * Separate from matter_case.c so an image with the client compiled out is byte
 * for byte the image that existed before it -- see the CMakeLists.
